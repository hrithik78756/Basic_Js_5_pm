    <h3>1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs directly in
        the
        browser and is one of the core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h3>2. Why JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>It powers most modern websites.
        It is beginner-friendly yet extremely powerful.
        It works on both frontend and backend (with Node.js).
        It has a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
    </p>
    <h3> 3. Where Does JavaScript Run?</h3>
    <p>In the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
        On servers using Node.js
    </p>
    <h3> 4. How JavaScript Works in a Web Page</h3>
    <p>A JavaScript file can be added to an HTML page using:
        <script src="app.js"></script>
        or written directly inside:
        <script>
            console.log("Hello");
        </script>
    </p>
    <h4> JavaScript Syntax Basics <hr>
        Statements end with semicolons (optional but recommended). <hr>
        JavaScript is case-sensitive. <hr>
        Code runs from top to bottom. <hr>
        console.log() <hr>
        This is used to print output to the browser console and is one of the most important tools for beginners.</h4>
